A simple game of snake implemented in WebGL.

Use left and right arrow keys to turn the snake.

Some of the code is shameless ripoff of [Giles Thomas'es Learning WebGL tutorial](learningwebgl.com)

Run `./get-deps` script to get all the dependencies.

Due to some Cross-Origin restrictions this game won't if you point it to file:// location restrictions this game won't if you point browser to file:// location.
The best way to overcome it is to serve it locally, for example run `python3 -m http.server 8080` and browse to `localhost:8080`.
